i need to make a custom page for a presentation context.

basically, it will be a presentation that will work similarely to kahoot. 
workflow i thought was:
display r code / url on the screen,
people in the room scan it and they are quickly prompted with a inputbox that will be "how many clients you have in your database" and avg comission
on screen of the presenter it will display stats: total people in databases, other stats that will display: addiotional sales (((avg comission * 0.46)*0.14)*0.5) rounded up
each people that input info will have their personal stats calculated for their stats
this needs to work live so it needs to update live (using event manager or idk so it handles it like a kahoot would)

then once presenter clicks a btn at the botom it wil change state of presenter screen and local screens will be redirectedto this page" www.logipret.ca/logitext"

the ui for the first part needs to be using branding from the clickon.txt file that contains styling
